## Hey Marcy!
A splash page so you can get in touch.

      This is a work in progress. 
      I have a number of 'TODOs', including:
      • clean up file structure
      • refactoring to bring all variables to the content file
      • a contact form
      • grab the browser object Date();
      • create & display a different theme for different times of the day
      • an animated contact form
      • animated background
